// In the last tutorial I talked about weight and height
// but there are many ways to weigh and measure.
// Weight: pounds, grams, kilograms, milligrams, ounces
// Measurement: centimeter, feet, inch, millimeter

// Let's say I sell oranges in different forms.
// Per Orange: $.45
// Per Pound: $1.14 
// Orange Juice (16oz): $2.43

// A union allows you store one piece of data that can
// be of a different type. You can't store multiple
// values though. 

// It wouldn't be normal if a customer asks to buy one 
// orange, for you to quote the price for just the juice.
// A union also doesn't store all 3 values, but instead
// only 1 of the 3.
